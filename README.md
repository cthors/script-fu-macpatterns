layers-to-patterns.scm : Saves each layer in the current document to a .pat pattern file for use with the paint can tool, etc. Gives the option to enlarge the layer by 4x or 8x.

mac_patterns.xcf : a sample file for layers-to-patterns

how-to: Copy layers-to-patterns.scm to the GIMP's script folder. "Layers to Patterns" should now appear at the bottom of the Filters menu. Open mac_patterns.xcf and run "Layers to Patterns" to create a bunch of new patterns.
